Tastebuds (formerly Gourmand): A MERN Stack Project
=====================================


Motivation
----------

It can be a pain to decide on a restaurant amoung a large group. Why not vote on it? TasteBuds lets you easily vote on available restaurants nearby, thanks to Yelp's powerful API. Inviting your friends to vote is as easy as sharing a URL link to the poll, and results will be automatically shared once the poll is closed.



Usage
-----

To anonymously create a poll, simply type in a email where you'd like to receive the link to administer the poll (no verification required). 
Then follow prompts to input desired location and price range, and click "Create Poll". 
Next share the url w/ your friends, and vote on your preferred food -- polls from poll participants will show in real time. 
Once you're ready, click "End Poll", and select a restaurant from the recommendations, and share it with your friends by clicking "Share Selection". The poll result will be pushed to all participants.
P.S. You can register at any time to be able to track your active / past polls in your dashboard.

This app was lovingly crafted by 2 developers. It uses the full MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) and Yelp API. The latest hosted instance might be from a private version of this repo.
